# FindMeAtm
Main purpose of the program is to find the most suitable ATM in a city.

First task is to develop Android program by using Kotlin. What does this program do? Main
purpose of the program is to find the most suitable ATM in a city. Suitable means that the person who
want to use an ATM will find the most time-efficient ATM for withdraw and cash-deposit. Nowadays, bank
applications have a feature that they can show you the nearest atm by only distance from the point.
However, this program will have additional feature which will show the atm that the person will spend less
time by using it. It can be considered as a step for smart city apps. Basically, the algorithm of the program
that it can be imagined that there is some information how many people are in queue for the ATMs (This
info can be handled by using image recognition or any sensor network applications). The program will
compare that which ATM is going to be fast to finish your process in less time rather than using the
nearest one. In this program, there is needed a data set. This data set will be created as a random instead
of real information. Also, the program will have user-friendly interface which can be implemented to any

bank apps. In addition, it is trying to use the ability of Kotlin which interoperability with JAVA in this
